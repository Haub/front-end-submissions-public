# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
Karin - [happy code](https://github.com/foxwellm/PalettePickerApi/blob/597d1e8db2865699ae940556dfeeb87b3178acc4/app.js#L128-L159)
Matt - [happy code](https://github.com/foxwellm/PalettePickerApi/blob/master/app.js#L10-L34)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Karin - this was the first time I've created PUT endpoints, also used requiredParameter to give useful error messages.
Matt - this was the first time I've created an endpoint with query params, enjoyed thinking about the logic.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
API test - [sad code](https://github.com/kaohman/PalettePicker/blob/master/src/utils/api.test.js#L14-L25)
Thunk test - [sad code](https://github.com/kaohman/PalettePicker/blob/master/src/thunks/__tests__/fetchProjects.test.js#L59-L88)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
We had a couple issues with some tests that we had to leave skipped. For instance, using environment variables in testing and testing a thunk that calls another thunk.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

We really wanted to share link functionality for our individual endpoints. After the user clicks the share icon, the UI tells them that the link was copied.

#### Reflection on New Concepts

* Describe your thoughts on server-side testing - It's easier than frontend testing. It was straightforward and Will's lesson on server-side testing was helpful.
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI - It was difficult to get set up initially but once it was set up, it significantly helped our workflow.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories - It was helpful having experience using multiple repos from Mod 3, so we felt prepared to deal with it on this project.
