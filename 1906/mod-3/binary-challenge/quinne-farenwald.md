### Comments:

* Cool loading page! The kerning on "Shuttle Service" I think is intentional, getting a little hard to read for me
* Nice form input validation - very clear when I was done
* What are your future iterations for this app?

* 31 tests passing - a couple proptype errors (double-check how you are initiating props in tests for various components)
* Skipped test in `App`

* Nice job having a utils file and testing that
* Overusing "exact" in some routing

## Rubric 

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - The codebase has less than 5 linter errors and README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset and updated them as changes were made. A project management tool was continuously used from the beginning of the project.  All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and concise commit messages. 

### React Architecture

* 3 - React architecture is clean and organized.  Logic is kept out of return statements.  There are some issues with the asynchronous js where the frontend is not matching with the backend.  There are multiple functions (including fetch calls) that are doing similar pieces of functionality that could continue to be refactored. Data fetched from API is not cleaned before being set to state.

### Redux Architecture

* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async functionality.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.  UX is clear and set up well so that user has access to previous routes.
